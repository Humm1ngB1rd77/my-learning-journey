# My learning journey

## About this repository  
This repository was created to serve as a connection to my web project and houses all the projects showcased on the website.

## Updates
New projects are posted as soon as they are completed. Since I am balancing personal learning with my college studies, it may take some time to finish each project, but I always strive to do my best and deliver quality work.

## Accesibility
All projects and their presentations in this repository can be viewed and accessed through the website in my Web-project repository.
